An attempt to make a raycaster in rust. 

It ouputs to the terminal using ascii charecters.

It does not depend on any external libraries. Although using tui-rs or ncurses could've been a lot smarter choice but I wanted it be made using only std.

output :

It could've been a lot better if I knew how these raycasters work or understand the maths properly.

There are a lot of room for improvement and a lot of bugs in the code.

Do not read the code if you don't want to damage your brain by reading ugly and bad code.
